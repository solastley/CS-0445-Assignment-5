# CS-0445-Assignment-5
This assignment utilizes binary trees to implement a Huffman Encoder and Decoder. The program reads in an input file that contains a representation of a Huffman Tree and then creates a real tree of Binary Tree Nodes from that text representation. It then creates a Huffman encoding table and allows the user to encode or decode words of their choosing.
